S- Single responsibility.
The single responsibility principle states that every class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software.

/FIRST EXAMPLE
  - public class DefaultDecoder : IDecoder
The DefaultDecoder is concerned only with decoding data.

/SECOND EXAMPLE
  - public class DefaultEncoder : IEncoder
The DefaultEncoder is concerned only with encoding data.

SUMMARY: That way we dont have classes which mix different functionality in this case decoding and encoding together.This way we follow SRP which is described above.



O- Open close principe.
Open/closed principle states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

/FIRST EXAMPLE
   - public class HttpRequest
Can be inherited and in that way its funcionality can be extended.
Its private methods(SetupData,SetupBody,SetupAuthentication, etc.) ensure that third parties can not modify its funcionality.
This way we follow OCP which is described above.

/SECOND EXAMPLE
   -  public class MultiPartStreamer
Can be inherited and in that way its funcionality can be extended.
Its private methods(CreateFormBoundaryHeader,CreateFileBoundaryHeader) ensure that third parties can not modify its funcionality.
This way we follow OCP which is described above.

L- Liskov substitution.



I- Interface segregation principle.

 ISP splits interfaces which are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

/FIRST EXAMPLE
------------------------------------------------------------------
namespace EasyHttp.Contracts
{
    public interface IEncoder
    {
        byte[] Encode(object input, string contentType);
    }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------
The interface  IEncoder  has method Encode which return array of bytes. In that way the interface follows the ISP, which is explaned above.

/SECOND EXAMPLE
------------------------------------------------------------------
 public interface IDecoder
    {
        T DecodeToStatic<T>(string input, string contentType);

        dynamic DecodeToDynamic(string input, string contentType);
    }
------------------------------------------------------------------
The interface IDecoder describes methods only related to decoding.In that way the interface follows the ISP, which is explaned above.

SUMMARY:By having IEncoder and IDecoder as two separate interfaces we ensure that another user want have to creater decoder class that has method for encoding.



D- Dependency inversion.
When following this principle, the conventional dependency relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are inverted (i.e. reversed), thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module implementation details

/FIRST EXAMPLE
------------------------------------------------------------------
   - public class HttpClient
the constructor: 
  public HttpClient(IEncoderDecoderConfiguration encoderDecoderConfiguration, IUriComposer composer)
All modules that this class need are passed trough the constructor.This way the class is not dependant on concrete implementations of the interfaces.

/SECOND EXAMPLE
------------------------------------------------------------------
  - public class HttpRequest
the constructor: 
  public HttpRequest(IEncoder encoder)
The class is not dependant on concrete implementations of IEncoder.
That way we follow the DIP.
